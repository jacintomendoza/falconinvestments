        Your "cost basis" related to any security you hold refers to the price you paid for that security and can be adjusted by items such as return of capital, commission or transaction fees. Please see https://investor.vanguard.com/taxes/cost-basis/ for more detailed information on cost basis. When "covered" securities are sold, Vanguard reports the cost basis to you and the IRS; however, when "noncovered" securities are sold, Vanguard does not report the cost basis to the IRS. You are responsible for tracking and reporting the cost basis of your securities. In cases where the cost basis of a security is unknown, Vanguard will assume a cost basis of zero, therefore, the lotâ€™s gain will be equal to the proceeds.
